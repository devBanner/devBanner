## About
**devBanner** is a collaboration project first started in devRant. It's aimed at creating personalized banners for everyone without using photo manipulation software. It currently creates personalized banners including your own subtext for devRant members using the devRant API.

## Current Features
- Your own subtext. You can write some lengthy subtext as well!
- Lightweight. Almost all banners are under 500KB, so no problem downloading and using anywhere!
- Banner size selection (width)

## Upcoming Features
- Ability to edit banner component styles (position, font, colors)
- Social media export
- Improved banner designs
- Wallpaper support

## I want one!
Looks like you are interested in creating your own banner, aren't you?

Well, it is easier than you think.

1. Open up your FAVORITE browser.
2. Head up to https://devbanner.center .
3. You will be greeted by the new beautiful, colorful frontend by Skayo.
4. Fill in the form. You just have to type your devRant username and your own subtext. You can even write some nerd-y subtexts. (But we don't support xalgo..... Sorry)
5. After a few seconds, the generated banner will appear below. Press the download button. (In older browsers, it may open in another tab. To save, right-click and click Save As... button)
6. Use it everywhere!

(*Based on the frontend in 10th Jan 2018*)
